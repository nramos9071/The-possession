                    The following takes place during a recent long rest and you are passing Wandell in the corridor of the Fred's Fish Fry. 
                    Everyone else seems to be asleep. You and Wandell are the only ones still awake...

                    You are walking towards your bed to finally rest after a long day of fighting and working with the crew of the Fred's Fish Fry.
                    You see Wandell walking towards the crew quarters. You had been meaning to talk to him. The past few days Wandell has been 
                    a little...off.

                    You walk into the cargo hold. Wandell seems to be doing something extremely strange. He is looking straight at the wall of 
                    the cargo hold. A purple aura surrounds Wandell. You slowly walk to be in front of him. Before you can get in front of him
                    you are suddenly in bed with Xadalli. Your ass hurts again...

                    see that his eyes are rolled back and seems to be suffering. You reachout to him but before you can touch him you are suddenly
                    in your bed with Olga next to you. She seems to have a satisfied grin on her face.

                    You walk into the cargo hold. Wandell seems to be doing something extremely strange. He is looking straight at the wall of 
                    the cargo hold. A purple aura surrounds Wandell. You slowly walk to be in front of him. You get in front of him and you 
                    see that his eyes are rolled back and seems to be suffering. You reachout to him but before you can touch him, Wandell's 
                    hand grabs yours. His eyes have turned purple and he looks at you with an angry look. "You dare disturb your patron?" You look 
                    confused. Wandell is young. He definitely isn't younger than you.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    "I am not Wandell...or Wandell isn't the one talking to you." You begin to wonder who is Wandell. "I can feel your thoughts.
                    No. This is not my body. Your party seems to occasionally need my help. For some reason, you all are not smart enough to do what
                    I need you to do. In time, I will need you to do my bidding. And When that time comes, I need you to complete my tasks withhout question."
                    Before you can say anything back you are back in your bed. You seem to have slept alone. Normally this a sad thing, but with the company you 
                    have kept recently, this is the first night you were not pegged by Xadalli nor had to sleep next to Olga. Maybe this was a good night...

                    You walk into the room and you immediately can tell that the energy coming from Wandell is not Wandell. You immediately can
                    tell that this is your Patron...

                    <br/>

                    body. It seems your party seems to occasionally needs my help. For some reason, you all are not smart enough to do what
                    I need you to do. In time, I will need you to do my bidding. And When that time comes, I need you to complete my tasks withhout question.
                    until that moment, lets keep this little encounter between ourselves..." Before you can say anything back you are back in your bed. You seem to have slept alone. Normally this a sad thing, but with the company you 
                    have kept recently, this is the first night you were not pegged by Xadalli nor had to sleep next to Olga. Maybe this was a good night...

                    You decide to go back to your room. Who cares what Wandell is doing. I go to bed with both Xadalli and Olga. You thought
                    you were going to finally get a proper threesome. Instead Xadalli decides she still wants to peg you and you are forced to
                    "take care" of Olga.
